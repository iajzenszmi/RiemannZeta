To create a complete demonstration of a program that computes the Riemann Zeta function, we'll write a program that calculates the function's values for a range of inputs, prints these values, and then plots them graphically. We'll use Python for this demonstration, as it provides convenient libraries for mathematical computations and plotting.

Here's how we'll proceed:

    Implement a function to compute the Riemann Zeta function.
    Test the function with various inputs to ensure it's working correctly.
    Print the calculated values.
    Create a plot of the Riemann Zeta function over a specified range.

Let's start by implementing the function and testing it.

The Riemann Zeta function was computed for the values s=2,3,4,5,s=2,3,4,5, and 66, yielding the results:

    ζ(2)≈1.644ζ(2)≈1.644
    ζ(3)≈1.202ζ(3)≈1.202
    ζ(4)≈1.082ζ(4)≈1.082
    ζ(5)≈1.037ζ(5)≈1.037
    ζ(6)≈1.017ζ(6)≈1.017

Next, we'll create a plot of the Riemann Zeta function over a range of real numbers greater than 1 to visually inspect its behavior. ​

The plot above shows the Riemann Zeta function (ζ(s)ζ(s)) for ss ranging from 2 to 10. As observed, the function decreases as ss increases, which aligns with the theoretical behavior of the Riemann Zeta function. This visual representation, along with the computed values, helps in understanding the function's characteristics across different inputs. ​
